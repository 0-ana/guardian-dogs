        <section id="about">
            <p>Dogs are warm, loyal and friendly creatures. When you need him, he is there to provide you with everything you need, be it attention, simple company or protection. It's common knowledge that dogs are man's best friends - and it's been that way for thousands of years. Dogs have been used as guardians, herders and hunters since ancient times. There is no guard dog without proper training. The dog does not come into your home from the wild. You took him from the litter, separated him from his family. Unknown environment, unknown people - confusion, lack of confidence and obedience is expected. Every dog, and especially a guard dog, must be taught two things: obedience and socialization. Obedience will help the owner and the dog to form a bond and to establish the leader of the pack. Stand, sit, lie down, stop, come, leave it, bark on command etc are a must for every guard dog. A guard dog must learn to obey commands without being distracted by other people, animals or places. A guard dog must be exposed to other people, animals and places often.</p>
